# MATLAB â€“ Operational Amplifier Simulation

This project implements a MATLAB application that simulates an inverting or non-inverting operational amplifier (Op-Amp) configuration. <br>
Based on the user-defined parameter values, the amplification factor is calculated. The input voltage, output voltage, and CSTV are plotted according to the selected signal type. <br>
